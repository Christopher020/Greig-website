                <p>NAVTEX (NAVigational TEleX), sometimes styled Navtex or NavTex,[1] is an international automated medium frequency direct-printing service for delivery of navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent maritime safety information (MSI) to ships. 
                    NAVTEX was developed to provide a low-cost, simple, and automated means of receiving this information aboard ships at sea within approximately 370 km (200 nautical miles) off-shore. </p>

                <h2>Ship Security and Alert System (SSAS): </h2>
                <p>The Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) is a safety measure for strengthening ship’s security and subduing acts of piracy and/or terrorism against shipping. Widely Acknowledged as a part of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS code), the Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) complements the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s attempts to increase maritime vessel security.  </p>

                <h2>Voyage Data Recorders(VDR):</h2>
                <p>Voyage data recorder, or VDR, is a data recording system designed for all vessels required to comply with the IMO's International Convention SOLAS Requirements (IMO Res.A.861(20)) in order to collect data from various sensors on board the vessel. It then digitizes, compresses and stores this information in an externally mounted protective storage unit. The protective storage unit is a tamper-proof unit designed to withstand the extreme shock, impact, pressure and heat, which could be associated with a marine incident (fire, explosion, collision, sinking, etc.). </p>

                <p>Bridge Navigational Watch & Alarm System – BNWAS is a monitoring and Alarm system which notifies other navigational officers or master of the ship if the officer on watch (OOW) does not respond or he/she is incapable of performing the watch duties efficiently, which can lead to maritime accidents. 
                    The purpose of a bridge navigational watch alarm system (BNWAS) is to monitor bridge activity and detect operator disability which could lead to marine accidents. </p>
